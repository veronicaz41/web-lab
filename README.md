# snarkjs-starter

A starter project for snarkjs apps.

Currently, snarkjs is [broken in browser](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs/issues/107). So we are on pinned to snarkjs [0.4.7](https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs/tree/4d8721829fb2392d7a912b66d24d82ee16acee7b) and circom1 [0.5.45](https://github.com/iden3/circom_old/tree/0f6f730e37bda28a966f8aaa2fb2da2ec5c8cd20).
